  "Guardrail": "Check that only authorized administrative Principals are allowed AWS KMS administrative permissions.",
  "Rationale": "AWS Key Management Service (KMS) makes it easy for you to create and manage cryptographic keys and control their use across a wide range of AWS services and in your applications. It is important that access control to the management of your keys is only performed by authorized administrative key management administrators.",
  "Remediation": "Verify that KMS administrative and modification permissions are explicitly denied to non-whitelisted Principals and that the KMS modification permissions don't exist in an Allow statement for any unauthorized principal.",
